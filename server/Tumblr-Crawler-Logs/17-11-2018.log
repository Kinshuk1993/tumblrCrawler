Unsurprisingly the weight of history in its walls has led to sightings of ghosts and spirits on the hospital&rsquo;s wards.</p>\n<p>Some extremely rational people, including respected doctors and nurses, have been unable to explain the things they have seen there. And several apparitions have been spotted on more than one occasion by different people.</p>\n<p>The floating sister looks at first glance like a normal member of staff making her way around the hospital - that is until you look down and see that she is only visible from the knees up.<br />A well-respected nurse who worked at the Royal Infirmary in the late 20th century spoke to the apparition as she passed before realising the bottom part of her legs were not visible.<br />She though the ghost may have been walking along an older floor level which had since been moved.</p>\n<p>Dying patients have long been documented as appearing to talk to people who are not really there, as they approach they end of their lives. Sometimes people will appear to see relatives that have also passed on. But there is one spirit who often makes an appearance at the bedside of dying patients in Glasgow&rsquo;s Royal Infirmary. A number of different people in the hospital&rsquo;s ward 27 have reported to have seen and spoke to a man called Archie. He has also manifested on occasions and has been reported as being elderly and wearing a hair bun.</p>\n<p>With every place with multiple ghosts there is always a Grey Lady and the Infirmary is no different This apparition has been spotted on a number of occasions over the decades.<br />The lady is dressed in grey and has been seen walking down corridors and then disappearing through a door. Staff have chased after her only to find her vanished without a trace.</p>\n<p>The dead man walking, sounds like a film eh?! This spooky incident happened relatively recently in the early 21st century.<br />A doctor was responding to a call to help with a patient who had suffered a heart attack. On his way a patient asked him for directions on how to get out of the hospital and the doctor pointed him in the right direction. When the doctor arrived with the patient he&rsquo;d been called to, the man had already died. But the shocked doctor was horrified to see that the patient was the same man he had given directions to.</p>\n<p>Want more Glesga ghosts?

It&rsquo;s the easiest country to move to for Brazilians and the whole process to obtain a DNI (the Argentinian national identity) takes 90 days and you get a 2 year visa, which you can later turn into a permanent residency visa without much trouble. It&rsquo;s very affordable, we don&rsquo;t even need to translate the documents thanks to a bilateral agreement and you don&rsquo;t have to prove you have a job lined up for you or anything. Unless Brazil leaves the Mercosur, there&rsquo;s no need to go so far as to ask for refuge if you choose Argentina as your destination.</p>"},{"blog":{"name":"nakedsilver","active":true,"theme":{"header_full_width":1280,"header_full_height":427,"header_focus_width":759,"header_focus_height":427,"avatar_shape":"square","background_color":"#EDC256","body_font":"Helvetica Neue","header_bounds":"0,1019,427,260","header_image":"https://static.tumblr.com/ac24f1bb73241ea2c1393f710678c7b5/dnnpluo/UwJpa32bc/tumblr_static_asg9q8ml73ksog480kcc0c0kg.png","header_image_focused":"https://static.tumblr.com/ac24f1bb73241ea2c1393f710678c7b5/dnnpluo/qldpa32bm/tumblr_static_tumblr_static_asg9q8ml73ksog480kcc0c0kg_focused_v3.png","header_image_scaled":"https://static.tumblr.com/ac24f1bb73241ea2c1393f710678c7b5/dnnpluo/UwJpa32bc/tumblr_static_asg9q8ml73ksog480kcc0c0kg_2048_v2.png","header_stretch":true,"link_color":"#FFFEF1","show_avatar":false,"show_description":true,"show_header_image":true,"show_title":false,"title_color":"#8F6213","title_font":"Calluna","title_font_weight":"regular"},"share_likes":false,"share_following":false,"can_be_followed":true},"post":{"id":"179604346537"},"content_raw":"<p>thank you so much for your addition! reblog this please</p>","content":"<p>thank you so much for your addition! reblog this please</p>"},{"blog":{"name":"atrperro","active":true,"theme":{"avatar_shape":"square","background_color":"#FAFAFA","body_font":"Helvetica Neue","header_bounds":"","header_image":"https://static.tumblr.com/7b1293bc74fa1ef29a3a4892f9faf907/gthovbi/jl1pb64rr/tumblr_static_8lhybtvthyo8oscwcwkwo0koo.png","header_image_focused":"https://static.tumblr.com/7b1293bc74fa1ef29a3a4892f9faf907/gthovbi/jl1pb64rr/tumblr_static_8lhybtvthyo8oscwcwkwo0koo_2048_v2.png","header_image_scaled":"https://static.tumblr.com/7b1293bc74fa1ef29a3a4892f9faf907/gthovbi/jl1pb64rr/tumblr_static_8lhybtvthyo8oscwcwkwo0koo_2048_v2.png","header_stretch":true,"link_color":"#529ECC","show_avatar":true,"show_description":true,"show_header_image":true,"show_title":true,"title_color":"#bad8eb","title_font":"Sans Serif","title_font_weight":"bold"},"share_likes":false,"share_following":false,"can_be_followed":true},"post":{"id":"179605794160"},"content_raw":"<p>if you plan to do this, id suggest you do it as quickly as possible, because its been said bolsonaro wants to leave mercosur </p>","content":"<p>if you plan to do this, id suggest you do it as quickly as possible, because its been said bolsonaro wants to leave mercosur </p>"}],"can_like":true,"can_reblog":true,"can_send_in_message":true,"can_reply":true,"display_avatar":true},{"type":"text","blog_name":"oh-glasgow","blog":{"name":"oh-glasgow","title":"Oh, Glasgow!","description":"Everything that makes Glasgow the unique city that I love.\nGlasgow humour, Glasgow politics, and Glasgow music.
